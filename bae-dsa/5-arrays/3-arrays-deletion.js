/*
DELETION
Javascript implements array deletion with .pop() method. This method removes the last-added element of the array. This also returns the removed element.

let array1 = [1,2,3,4]
array1.pop() //returns 4, array = [1,2,3]
array1.pop() //returns 3, array1 = [1,2]

The time complexity of .pop() is O(1) similarly to .push. Another way to remove an element from an array is with the .shift() method. This method will remove the first element and return it.

array1 = [1,2,3,4]
array1.shift() //returns 2, array1 = [3,4]
