/*
INSERTION
Insertion means adding a new element inside a data structure. Javascript implements array insertion with the .push(element) method. This method adds a new element at the end of the array.
let array1 = [1,2,3,4]
array1.push(5) //array1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
array1.push(7) //array1 = [1,2,3,4,5,7]
array1.push(2) //array1 = [1,2,3,4,5,7,2]
