/*
INSERTION
Insertion means adding a new element inside a data structure. Javascript implements array insertion with the .push(element) method. This method adds a new element at the end of the array.

let array1 = [1,2,3,4]
array1.push(5) //array1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
array1.push(7) //array1 = [1,2,3,4,5,7]
array1.push(2) //array1 = [1,2,3,4,5,7,2]

The time complexity of this operation is O(1) in theory. It sahould be noted that, practically, this depends on the Javascript engine that runs the code. This applies to all natively supported Javascript objects.
