INTRODUCING ARRAYS
Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures. If you have ever programmed before, you've most likely used an array.
let array1 = [1,2,3,4];

For any data structure, developers are interested in time and space complexity associated with the four fundamental operations: 
access, insertion, deletion, and search.
(For a review of Big-O notations, please refer to Chapter 1).
