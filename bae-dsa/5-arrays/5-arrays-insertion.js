/*
Iteration
Iteration is the process of accessing each of the items contained within a data structure. There are multiple ways to iterate through an array in JavaScript. They all have a time complexity of O(n) since the iteration is visiting n number of elements.

for (Variables; Condition; Modification)
for is the most common method of iteration. It is most often used in this form: 1 for ( var i=0, len=array1.length; i<len; i++ ) {
2 3}
console.log(array1[i]);

The previous code simply means initialize the variable i.
