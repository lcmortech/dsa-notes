/*
STRING COMPARISON
- Most programming languages have a function that allows you to compare strings. In Javascript, this can be done simply by using less-than and greater-than operators.
var a = 'a'
var b = 'b'
console.log(a < b) // prints 'true'

- This can be really useful for comparing strings when sorting algorithms, which is covered later in the book. However, if you are comparing two strings of different lengths, it starts comparing from the start of the string until the length of the smaller string.

let a = 'add'
let b = 'b'
console.log(a < b) // prints 'true'

In this example, a and b are compared. Since a is smaller than b, a < b evaluates to true.
